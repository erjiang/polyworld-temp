* try a random population on the same environment used to study the seeded population
* investigate mating genetics

------------

* compute and display LifeSpan1000, LifeSpan stats computed over the last 1,000 time steps -- a sort of "generational lifespan", since the maximum lifespan is 1,000 time steps (though since the average more like 400 to 600+, it's represents something close to two generations)

* compute and write to stats file PopulationBand# stats and PopulationBand#1000 stats, that compute population counts present in a given z-band.  Make the z-bands correspond to the food bands, but allow an arbitrary-sized adjacent strip to be included.  Run with adjacent strip sizes of 0 and 5, at least.  Compute the values for the foodless band as well.

* turn off barriers entirely for these experiments?

* try with food band combos of (50%, 0%), (45%, 5%), (40%, 10%), (35%, 15%), (30%, 20%), (25%, 25%)

* examine time histories of population counts for all food band combos -- can they be related to a theoretically optimum patch selection behavior?

* examine time histories of average lifespan for all experiments -- any differences?  when do they peak relative to population count stabilization and approach of the theoretically optimum behavior?

* what about seeded populations versus random populations, on all of these?
